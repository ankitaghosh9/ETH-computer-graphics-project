    <h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>
      <p >
        'Man on Mars', a subject of discussion since ages in the scientific community and a topic of wonder for the humankind. As we carelessly burn through the
        life resources available on Earth, we devise new ways to invade Mars and make it habital. The debate on what life on Mars will look like goes on endlessly.
        Through our project, we attempt to present our version of this topic as we take a man, out of his place on Earth, onto the surface of Mars. 
        <br/> <br/>
        <div style="text-align: center;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display:block">
          <img src="images/introduction/ManOnMars.png" alt="Man on Mars" style="width: 25.5vw; min-width: 330px;"/>
          
          <img src="images/introduction/ManOnMarsBG.png" alt="Man on Mars" style="width: 30vw; min-width: 330px;"/>
        </div>
        <br/> <br/>
        We are using the images above as our source of inspiration. These conform with the theme 'out of place' as the picture on the left depicts an astronaut
        walking on Mars. We plan to showcase a human figure standing on a terraformed version of Mars. By taking some artistic 
        inspiration from the image on the right, we plan to ornate the sky with various cestial bodies. Thus our final scene will look like an amalgamation of
        the two scenes giving an undertone of an out of the world view.

    <h3> Images as Textures </h3>
        Relevant files: <br />
        <code>
            lodepng.cpp <br />
            lodepng.h <br />
            imagetexture.cpp <br />
        </code>
        <br />
        I implemented the images as texture feature using the  <code>lodepng</code> library by adding <code>lodepng.cpp</code> and <lodepng.h>
        files which makes using PNG images very easy and lightweight.
        I referred to the lecture [1] on texture mapping which helped me understand the concept.
        In <code>imagetexture.cpp</code>, for a given pair of \((u,v)\) coordinates, I return the \((r,g,b)\) values present at the \((x,y)\) location of my texture map as the albedo. To ensure right albedo value is sent,
        I scale the \((u,v)\) coordinates according to the height and width of the texture map. Additionally, I apply inverse gamma
        correction so that the original colour of the texture is retained. Below, I show a comparison between the results obtained from
        my texture mapping and from Mitsuba. <br /> <br />
        <div class="twentytwenty-container">
            <img src="images/imagetexture/imagetexturePlane.png" alt="Mine" class="img-responsive" />
            <img src="images/imagetexture/imagetexturePlaneMitsuba.png" alt="Mitsuba" class="img-responsive" />
        </div> <br />
        These are the results obtained on using images as textures on different objects. <br /><br />

    <h3> Normal Mapping </h3>
      Relevant files: <br />
      <code> normaltexture.cpp </code> <br />
      <code> bsdf.h </code> <br />
      <code> mesh.cpp </code> <br />
      <code> sphere.cpp </code> <br />
      <code> diffuse.cpp </code> <br />
      <br />
      Implementation of the normal mapping builds on the steps of using images as textures. It helps us add wrinkles and folds
      to the object through texture, even when they are not present in the object geometry. I gathered knowledge about this topic
      from the PBR [2] textbook. For doing this, we require
      normal maps which represent the surface normals of the texture through RGB values. My <code>normaltexture.cpp</code>
      code implements texturing mapping. I add functions in <code>bsdf.h</code> and <code>diffuse.cpp</code> which check if the
      texture has a normal map. If present, I linearly transform the color channels of the normal map from \([0,1]\) range to
      \([-1,1]\) range into a normal vector by multiplying with \(2 * value -1\). This computation is done in the
      <code>setHitInformation</code> function of the <code>mesh.cpp</code> and <code>sphere.cpp</code>.
      Below are two comparisons on the effect of normal mapping. I show the texture, the normals mapped on a plane surface and
      the texture and normal combined. <br /><br />

    <h3> Probabilistic Progressive Photon Mapping</h3>
      Relevant files: <br />
      <code> progressivephotonmap.cpp </code> <br />
      <code>integrator.h</code> <br />
      <code> render.cpp </code> <br />
      <br />
      The lecture slides and research paper [3] on this topic helped me understand how to implement probabilistic progressive photon mapping.
      To implement it, I first make addition of two new functions to the
      <code>integrator.h</code>: first, <code>getNumIters</code> so that I can access the number of iterations provided by the XML file,
      and second <code>iteration</code>, to clear the old photon map and build a new photon map for every iteration and also update
      the value of the radius for the new iteration according to the equation \( r_{i+1} = \sqrt{\frac{i+\alpha}{i+1}} r_i \). In the
      <code>render.cpp</code> file, I add an outer loop over the loop of sampling. This loops gets the value of iterations it needs
      to run from <code>getNumIters</code>. Inside this loop, before the smapling loop starts, I call the <code>iteration</code>
      function. Since Nori does running average, we do not need to implement that step and can view the final output directly.
      <br /><br />
      In the renderer, I clear out the stored image block after every iteration just for visualization purposes so that we
      can see the results obtained in each iteration. I use only 10% of the number of photons used for cbox photon mapping from 
      Programming Assignment 4 and 32 spp.
      These are shown below along with the value of radius at those iterations.
      (This line is then commented out while doing the running average.)
      <br /><br />

      </div> <br />

      Here I compare the results obtained by probabilistic progressive photon mapping (PP PMap) against normal
      photon mapping (PMap) and path importance sampling (Path MIS). The PP PMap performs significantly better than
      Path MIS. If we look closely at the edges and dielectric spheres, PP PMap performs better than PMap too.

    <h3> Environment Map Emitter</h3>
      Relevant files: <br />
      <code>
          envmap.cpp
      </code> <br /> <br />

      For implementing the environment map emitter, I follow the directions and pseudocode provided in the research paper [6].
      First I created a function from the image map by obtaining the luminance value. The marignal density and conditional density
      are obtained using the <code>precompute</code> functions given in the paper. The <code>sample</code> functions not only return
      \(u,v\) coordinate values but also calculate probability density values. The probability density value are then converted to
      one expressed in terms of solid angle on the sphere by introducing a Jacobian term. I map the \((u, v)\) sample to \((\theta, \phi) \) on the unit sphere by
      scaling it and then calculate the direction \((x, y, z)\) using it. I also perform bilinear interpolation to improve the output of the
      environment map. Since my environment map is attached to a sphere emitter, I do not need to handle anything additionally for <code>path_mis</code>
      as my implementation already accounts for mesh emitters.
      <br /> <br />
      I validate my implementation using the same scene to compare my render against Mitsuba. In the scene, I have placed a dielectric
      sphere, a diffuse sphere and a mirror sphere.
      <br /><br />

    <h3>Disney BSDF </h3>
      Relevant files:
      <br />
      <code>
          disney_BSDF.cpp <br />
          warp.h <br />
          warp.cpp <br />
          warptest.cpp <br />
      </code>
      <br /> <br />

      Disney BRDF gives a great range of flexibility which is why I took interest in implementing this feature. I referred to the
      paper [4] and the code provided by them for understanding the topic and its implementation.
      I implemented the subsurface, metallic,  specular, specularTint, roughness, clearcoat and clearcoatGloss parameters, omitting sheen and
      anisotropic effects. There exist several small variants to the diffuse and specularity implementation, which comes due to 
      artist preference as stated in the paper. To describe the specular lobes we need two variants of the Generalized-Trowbridge-Reit
      distribution (or GTR), one for the specularity term (GTR2) and another one for the clearcoat term (GTR1). The functions to perform
      <code>SquareToGRT1</code> and <code>SquareToGTR2</code> and their corresponding PDFs are added to the <code>warp.h</code> and
      <code>warp.cpp</code> files. I validate these, which are shown at the end of this section, and hence make required changes to
      <code>warptest.cpp</code>. The implementation of the Disney BSDF is done in the <code>disney_BSDF.cpp</code> file.

        Comparing DisneyBSDF with an existing implementation is very difficult since the principled BSDF implementation has
        differences for majority renderers. Since I have been comparing my results with Mitsuba for the project, I did the same for
        this feature too. Upon looking closely into Mitsuba's implementation I came to realise that their implementation of
        Principled BSDF is in such a way that it creates a certain difference in the albedo of the object. The scenes do not match
        exactly, however, they serve as a good reference is showing that the parameters get applied in a similar fashion. I provide
        two comparisons of applying my parameters with different values on Nori and Mitsuba.

    Further, I have also validated the implementation of my GTR1 and GTR2 functions throught warpTest and provided

    Non-local denoising filter performs averaging over similar pixels in the neighbourhood instead of just calculating a local mean.
    This results in denoised outputs where edges are preseved. To implement NL-means denoising, I took reference from our
    lecture slides [5].
    First, I calculated and stored the variance map of the scene in <code>render.cpp</code> by using sample mean variance.
    Then, I implemented the NL-means pipeline in the python file <code>denoise.py</code> present along with all other C++ source codes.
    In my python code, I majorly make use of the <code>numpy</code> library for the mathematical calculations. I also use
    <code>opencv</code> library to read the exr file and <code>scipy</code> library to perform convolution operation. I implement the
    pseudocode present in the lecture slide and denoise two different renders of the same scene using path_mis and 128spp, and
    path_mats and 512spp. For the paramaters, I use the values stated in the slides: \(r=10\), \(f=3\) and \(k=0.45\). The scene, the
    variance map, and the denoised scene for both the renders are shown below.

    <h2> Sayan Deb Sarkar </h2>
    <p> I have rendered all validation related scenes with mitsuba3, except for polynomial radial distortion, which
      to the best of my knowledge, is not there in mitsuba3 [7]. For that, I specifically used mitsuba 0.6 desktop GUI.
      For clarification and comparison purposes, the nori comparison with mitsuba images are rendered with 256 samples per pixel
      on my personal laptop, because of difficulty in setting up mitsuba on the euler cluster, while those 
      standalone of nori are rendered with 1024 samples per pixel, on the euler cluster, unless stated otherwise. The 
      corresponding integrator is always set as <code>path_mis</code> unless stated otherwise.

          <h4> Depth Of Field </h4>
            <p>
              To increase the realism of a scene, and to focus the viewer on specific parts of the image, I used 
              depth of field, which is simulated using a simple thinlens camera. I modified <code>src/perspective.cpp</code>
              to accept two camera related parameters, aperture of the lens and focal length. Depth of field is usually 
              simulated in graphics by calculating ray intersection with the focal plane, and then modifying the ray origin 
              as a point sampled on the lens and the direction as such that the ray passes through the point on the focal plane.
              For my validation, I show variations of the aforementioned parameters and try to focus on two different 
              subjects on the scene while simulatenously comparing with corresponding mitsuba renders. Starting with no 
              depth of field effect, I show step by step how experimenting with lens radius and focal length help me focus 
              on a desired subject at a time.

            <h4> Lens Distortion </h4>
              Initially, I wanted to extend perspective camera with a naive implementation of first order radial distortion. However, in the interest of 
              validation with mitsuba, I also ended up implementing polynomial radial distortion, both of which have been explained as follows.
              <h5> Radial Distortion </h5>
                Here, I followed the implementation of tensorflow to simulate quadratic radial distortion where, given a vector in 
                homogeneous coordinates, \( (x/z, y/z, 1) \), \(r\) is defined \(r^2 = (x/z)^2 + (y/z)^2\). Following this definition, I used the 
                simplest form of distortion function as \(f(r) = 1 + k * r^2\) with the distorted vector given as \( (f(r) * x/z, f(r) * y/z, 1)\).
                The reference can be found in tensorflow implementation of the same function [8]. The corresponding render with variation in values of 
                the distortion coefficient is shown below.

                </div> <br> <br>

                <h5> Polynomial Radial Distortion </h5>
                In the interest of proper validation of my implementation with an already avaiable renderer like mitsuba, I implemented polynomial 
                radial distortion following their code [9]. I specified the second and fourth-order terms in a polynomial
                model that accounts for pincushion and barrel distortion, as <code>k1</code> and <code>k2</code>. This is useful when trying to match 
                rendered images to photographs created by a camera whose distortion is known. The corresponding comparison with mitsuba render is shown 
                below.

          <h4> Chromatic Aberration </h4>
            <p>
              Chromatic aberration, also known as color fringing, is a color distortion 
              that creates an outline of unwanted color along the edges of objects in a photograph. It often appears when there's
              a high contrast between light and dark objects. On activation of the effect, <code>sampleRay()</code> in camera class is called 3 times, once for 
              each color channel and then summed for the final radiance. The amount of abberation for a given color channel is chosen as parameters 
              specified in the scene XML file and then position is zero-centered as well as the focus point is shifted in each direction by an offset.
              In the following images, I show comparisons of different parameters on two different scenes to understand how chromatic aberration usually 
              affects a captured photograph.

          </p>
          <p>
            I have implemented both kinds of media - scene-wide homogeneous medium and homogeneous medium attached to a shape, with the integrator updated 
            to handle both scenarios without use. The medium is parameterized by absorption coefficient <code>sigma_a</code>, scattering 
            coefficient <code>sigma_s</code> and the phase function (Henyey-Greenstein/isotropic in my implementation). Before moving onto the 
            integrator in the next section, I added functionality for handling of sampling volumetric scattering following PBRT implementation [2]. The major steps 
            are as follows :

            <ul>
              <li> Sampling a channel and distance along the incident ray </li>
              <li> Computing the transmittances and sampling density </li>
              <li> Returning weighting factor for scattering from homogeneous medium </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In the following images, I show comparisons of the sampled homogeneous medium scene-wide and attached to a sphere with corresponding
            mitsuba renders, using an isotropic phase function. As can be seen, these look pretty identical. The media were rendered 
            with a volunetric path tracer, described in the next subsection.

          <h4>Volumetric Path Tracer with Multiple Importance Sampling </h4>
            <p>
              I implemented a complex integrator, <code>volpath_mis</code>, which is based on <code>path_mis</code> and extends it with 
              sampling distances in media and sampling the phase function. My implementation uses multiple importance sampling and combines sampling 
              direct lighting with sampling the phase function. This gives us an efficient unidirectional volumetric path tracer. Unlike the PBRT 
              implementation [2], I do not have two different mediums attached to a shape in order to keep track of how the current medium changes. Instead, 
              I modified the integrator by using the dot product of the normal of the intersection point and the ray direction to keep track of 
              exiting and entering medium. I implemented a function <code>rayIntersectTr()</code> to calculate medium transmittances and thus, the 
              attenuation based on which media the ray is passing through. 

            </p>
            <p> To demonstrate validation of my implementation, I show comparison of the newly writtern volumetric path tracer with the path tracer 
              we wrote for Programming Assignment 4. Using the same scene without a medium, I show comparisons of both below, 
              which looks identical. In addition, in order to understand the effectiveness of importance sampling, I also show 
              comparisons by turning off multiple importance sampling, which makes it behave like the volumetric version of 
              <code>path_mats</code> and the original implementation.

            </p>

              To further validate the <code>volpath_mis</code> implementation, I followed the paradigm used in assignments. I modified the 
              <code>test-direct.xml</code> file from Progamming Assignment 4 to use the volumetric path tracer as the integrator and 
              the <code>test-furnace.xml</code> to add a homogeneous medium with 1.0 scattering and 0.0 absorption coefficients attached to a sphere
              for every scene. My implementation still passes all the tests as described below.

        <p>Henyey Greenstein phase function was specifically designed to be easy to fit to measured scattering data and is parameterized by 
          a single parameter \( g \), the asymmetry parameter, to control the light distribution. It is useful to be able to draw samples 
          from the distribution described by phase functions like applying multiple importance sampling to computing direct lighting in participating 
          media as well as for sampling scattered directions for indirect lighting samples in participating media. The PDF for the Henyey-Greenstein phase 
          function is separable into \( \theta \)  and \( \phi \) components, with \(p(\phi) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \). I followed the PBRT book [2] for the 
          implementation of this function by computing \(cos \theta \) and direction \(w_i \) for Henyey-Greenstein sample and then calculating the 
          PDF accordingly. In the following images, I show the following results in order :

          <p>
            My spotlight implementation is based on the implementation in the PBRT book. Spotlights are defined by two angles, 
            <code>falloffStart</code> and <code>totalWidth</code>. Objects inside the inner cone of angles, up to <code>falloffStart</code>, are 
            fully illuminated by the light. The directions between <code>falloffStart</code> and <code>totalWidth</code> are a transition zone that
            ramps down from full illumination to no illumination, such that points outside the <code>totalWidth</code> 
            cone aren't illuminated at all. However, for the purpose of validation, I changed the calculation of <code>cutOff</code> 
            value according to mitsuba implementation [7]. As can be seen in the images below, I show comparisons by putting two objects in the 
            original cbox scene to demonstrate the comparison of nori spotlight implementation with mitsuba.

            Perlin Noise is essentially a seeded random number generator, it takes an integer as a 
            parameter and returns a random number based on that parameter. I followed the referenced
            implementation for my understanding.  I used <code>persistence</code> and <code> octaves </code> to control 
            the noise texture [10]. Noise with a lot of high frequency as having a low persistence and octave is 
            each successive noise function added, just like in classical music. I also used cosine interpolation for smoothing, which 
            gives better texture at a slight loss of operating speed. Below I show perlin textures on various shapes, namely, a plane and 
            the camel head alongside rendering just perlin noise to demonstrate the validation of my approach.

            Textured Area Emitters was quite interesting to implement, since initially I was unable to understand how to make an emitter have radiance based 
            on texture, however, it was quite simple at the end. I added <code>uv</code> coordinate values to <code>EmitterQueryRecord</code> such that when
            evaluating the emitter, I can query the texture value corresponding to the given point and return that as the radiance. I adapted the integrators to
            follow this approach, meaning, I add the <code>uv</code> coordinate of the intersection point of a ray with the scene to be able to look up 
            during emitter evaluation. Below, I show a  perlin textured emitter as well as checkeboard textured emitter rendered using nori 
            and mitsuba, they look almost same, the offset is due to the handling of the texture in the two frameworks.

            In final gather, the hemisphere above the intersection point is sampled by shooting many rays and computing the radiance at the 
            intersection points of the sampled rays with a diffuse surface. I sampled rays using cosine hemispherical sampling based on the incident 
            ray direction. My implementation is based on Christensen's work [11]. I show 
            a direct comparison with the basic photon mapper to demonstrate how the indirect illumination accumulated using final gather helps 
            reduce blotches.

        <!-- <h3> Object Instancing </h3>
         <p>
          Instancing is a method of showing the same object mulitple times in the scene, without copying the object in the memory.
          Object instancing was a very tricky feature to implement which I was unable to generate results for However, I'll describe my approach. The 
          initial idea was to separate the transformations of a shape from the underlying mesh and then create multiple versions, ie, multiple transformations 
          of the same shape in BVH. However, after deliberation and understanding using the PBRT textbook, I thought of this approach : create an
          <code>Instance</code> class to hold a pointer to another primitive, the one I would instance. The <code>Instance</code> class conceptually 
          transforms the primitive but in reality, cannot modify the primitive. Instead, the total transformation <tt>T</tt> is stored and applied during 
          ray intersection. First, the inverse transformation would be applied to the ray and then the bounding box of the BVH node would be modified. 
          This was my idea for the implementation, however, I was unable to implement it to full clarity because I did not understand how to get access
          to the transform matrix of the scene within the <code>bvh</code> class.

            To be able to render on Euler, I essentially changed <code>main.cpp</code> to not use GUI. I renamed the file to <code>main_euler.cpp</code>
            for this submission. For validation, I show comparison of the rendered images using Euler and my personal laptop. 
            I have also used the text output of the rendering, to show that the same implementation on 
            euler took 12.0 seconds compared to 2.3 minutes on my system.
